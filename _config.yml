  Hey! My name is Carter Tomlenovich, on the internet I go by Hyperlisk. I enjoy programming and
  recording music. This website is all about my programming experience and contains a few things I need and
  hopefully other things that some other people might find cool. A tutorial for a few languages, some mistakes
  I've make along the way and some interesting things I have encoutered are going to be/have been documented on this site.
