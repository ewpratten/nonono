Hello World! This is my first ever jekyll post on my website. This is a new experiece and I would like to thank Evan Pratten for creating most of this website for me.
Go to his <a href="https://retrylife.ca">website</a>, he has some cool stuff over there! This blog will contain cool things I discover, tutorials and possible some updates to bigger projects I am working on. One such project being Magnus. A later post will explain all about my plans for Magnus and how I hope it can be used.
